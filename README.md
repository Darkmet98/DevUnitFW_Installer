## DevUnitFW Installer

A quick tool for installing the DevUnit Firmware in a Retail 3DS

This is not intended for installing anything else! You also should strictly avoid updating single titles because this also can lead to bricks!

Thanks to Profi200 for the sources of SysUpdater.

## Only use this if you know what you do! I'm not responsive for bricks which rely on wrong usage. Use it at your own risk.


### How to use

1. Install this app to your system.
  * It updates whatever NAND it is installed on. Installed on sysNAND for example it updates the build in NAND. Installed on emuNAND it updates emuNAND.
2. Create the dir "updates" in the root of the SD card of your 3DS.
3. Place the all .cia files in the update dir you created in step 2.
4. Start the app and follow the instructions.
